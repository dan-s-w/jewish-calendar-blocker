# Jewish Calendar Blocker
What this tool does:

- Creates calendar blocks for all Shabbat and Jewish holidays (2024-2034)
- Blocks your calendar from before candle lighting until 11:59 PM each Friday (shows as "Busy")
- Marks major holidays as "Out of Office" (Rosh Hashana, Yom Kippur, Sukkot, Pesach, Shavuot)
- Adds labels for weekly Torah portions (Parshiyot), candle lighting times, Havdalah times, Rosh Chodesh, fast days, Israeli holidays, Sefirat HaOmer, and more

⚠️ Disclaimer: Holiday dates are accurate from Hebcal (2024-2034), but candle lighting times are calculated astronomically and should be verified. Always double-check times before observance.
